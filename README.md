This Fabric mod gives keys attached to multiple keybindings a **pie menu** (aka pizza menu, circle selector, etc) that lets you choose the *desired action* when the key is pressed!

It also corrects the default keybind conflict behaviour for keys that you choose to not open a pie menu, so they will activate **all** bindings when pressed (and not just whichever one happened to be attached to the key last), similar to [Keybinds Fix].

Supports 1.21!

## If you got a message saying "A key was activated in a way that isn't expected!":

Please follow the instructions in [this issue](https://github.com/AV306/KeybindsGalore-Plus/issues/7), under "Pie menu does not open at all".

Long story short: there's a certain way that keybinds can be activated that does not seem to happen normally. Someone demonstrated that it *can* happen, probably with mods, so I need some more information on exactly what causes it to happen.

## Modifications to Original

- Reduced the list of keys which will never open a pie menu (more details [here](https://github.com/AV306/MultiBind/blob/master/docs.md))
- Optimised conflict searching and rendering (only checks for conflicts when the keybind setting menu is closed)
- Keybind labels now show their category along with their name, for easier identification ([example](https://github.com/AV306/MultiBind/blob/master/docs.md))
- Keybind labels can be customised! (see [this issue](https://github.com/AV306/KeybindsGalore-Plus/issues/3))
- Added a small "cancel zone" at the centre of the pie menu that will not activate any binding
- Label texts no longer run off the screen
- Made pie menu size, color, etc. configurable (config file automatically created in `.minecraft/config/multibind_config.properties`)
- Added config to prevent specific keys from opening a pie menu
- Added config to choose whether to use "fixed" keybind conflict behaviour (activates all bindings like KeybindsFix, not just whichever one happened to be stored) on keys that do not open pie menus
